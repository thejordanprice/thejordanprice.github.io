I am a guy that tends to push the boundaries as far they can.

I love to program and would love it to end up as an occupation.

I continue to code and enjoy it and try to get as 'best practice' as I can; with a little help from my friends of course (and google).
Within the last few years I went from only using my linux terminal to PHP which was a great stepping stone. PHP was fun and still is, but I knew it wasn't exactly 'the future' of anything; though there are many great projects created in PHP as with any language and I myself still have projects running places that I had created in PHP.

I soon moved on to learning JavaScript because a buddy had been going hard as a mofo in node.js for a while. I got kinda jealous about how well everything scaled great in different ways depending on your code. The fact it is also JavaScript driven helps me keep doing full stack setups in one language; front-end, back-end, middleware, doesn't matter, less stressful on the brain. So I started doing hello world node.sj apps and what have you. Now I have created many highly scalable webapps in node.js using express and other awesome middleware. It just takes time and a ton of bits of research (usually google: "[insert lang] the right way") or "lambda in python". lol.

Since then, I've realized that you can pretty much code anything if you put your mind to it. Being a hacker at heart I ended up finding horrid code and configurations on installations across networks and several devices, created a few proof of concept exploits and documented the vulnerabilities. Not all of them have been published, but some that I feel safe are publicly available in my github.

While I'm not coding, I would usually be fathering my daughter or at work slaving away at a place that has nothing to do with IT at all.
Playing drums has been quite an outlet for me as of lately; going in 4/4 to a 12/8 feel and shit just plays very well with my head.
My guitar playing has also been growing at an awesome rate to where I have successfully played most of the bluegrass songs that I had thought I never would.

I love graffiti and have always been amazed by it as it went by, so I now photograph and document as much of it as I can.

You now know more about me.

To be continued.

Never give up.

Love everyone.
