I am a guy that tends to push the boundaries as far they can.

I love to program and would love to have that as an occupation but as of lately it seems very hard to get in the door anywhere.
I continue to code and just enjoy it and try to get as 'best practice' as I can; with a little help from my friends of course (and google).
Within the last few years I went from only using my linux terminal to PHP which was a great stepping stone. PHP was fun and still is, but I knew it wasn't exactly 'the future' of anything; though there are many great projects created in PHP as with any language.
I soon moved on to learning JavaScript because a buddy had been going ham in node for a while. I got kinda jealous about how well everything scaled great in different ways depending on your code. So I started doing hello world node apps and what have you. Now I have created many highly scalable webapps in node.js using express and other awesome middleware. It just takes time and a ton of tiny bits of research (usually google: "[insert lang] the right way")

Since then, I've realized that you can pretty much code anything if you put your mind to it. I've found some horrid code on several devices, created a few proof of concept exploits and documented the vulnerabilities. Not all of them have been published, but some that I feel safe are publicly available in my github.

While I'm not coding, I would usually be fathering my daughter or at work slaving away at a place that has nothing to do with IT at all.
Playing drums has been quite an outlet for me as of lately; going in 4/4 to a 12/8 feel and shit just plays very well with my head.
My guitar playing has also been growing at an awesome rate to where I have successfully placed most of the bluegrass songs that I had thought I never would.
I love graffiti and have always been amazed by it as it went by, so I now photograph and document as much of it as I can.

You now know more about me.

Never give up.

Love everyone.
